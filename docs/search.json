    "text": "A full time university student on a quest to master the art of Artificial Intelligence. When I’m not busy convincing my code to run without breaking, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lens—because if AI doesn’t take over, at least I’ll have some great photos to document it! My life is a fine balance between training neural networks and training myself to survive on minimal sleep. Join me on this adventure where the only thing more complex than AI algorithms is figuring out how to frame the perfect picture!"

After finishing my studies, I took a gap year and worked with Biosensors, a company specialised in building catheters as an Research and Design Engineer. I really enjoyed my entire time there where I get to witness the behind the scene of the building something for inert of the body, how precise we have to be. As much as engineering is my forte, I do want to still continue my studies in something that the world is currently moving towards to which is technology. Hence, I made a decision to continue on studies in Degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence."
