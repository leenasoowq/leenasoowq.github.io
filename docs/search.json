I really enjoyed my time there where I get to witness the behind the scene of building something for the inert of body, how precise we had to be. As much as engineering is my forte, I do still want to continue my studies in something that the world is currently moving towards to which is technology. Hence, I made a decision to continue my studies, Degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\n\n\nAs a curious individual, I am never afraid to try new things. A few years back, I was very involved with powerlifting where I get the satisfactory whenever I hit my personal best. In recent years, I have gotten really fond of rockclimbing as well as travelling.

    "text": "Here are some of the projects I worked on over my course of study.\n\n1. Object-Oriented Programming\n\nThis was a game that my team and I built from the game engine to the game itself. The theme of this game is about space which allows players to use this game for educational purposes where they get to learn more about the space. In this project, my main task was to work on the scenes including of the management, rendering and transitioning.\nDifficulty Level: ★★★★☆\n\n\n2. Web Systems and Technologies\n\nFor this module, my team and I built a movie review webpage where users can create an account using Google or the traditional signin and signup. The users get to review the movies on our platform where they can also access their profile where they can see, edit and delete the reviews they made on any movie. The movies will constantly be refreshed to match up with the current movie trends.\nDifficulty Level: ★★★"
