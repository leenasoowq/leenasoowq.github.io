# Introduction

![](img/me.jpg){height=300 height=auto}

Hello! My name is Leena Soo. I am currently a student in Singapore Institute of Technology pursuing a degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence. 

## Education

I completed my O'Levels in 2018 and went to Singapore Polytechnic to pursue a Diploma in Bioengineering and graduated in 2022. 

## Career

After finishing my studies, I took a gap year to worked with Biosensors, a company specialised in building catheters as an Assistant Research and Design Engineer. I really enjoyed my time there where I get to witness the behind the scene of building something for the inert of body, how precise we had to be. As much as engineering is my forte, I do still want to continue my studies in something that the world is currently moving towards to which is technology. Hence, I made a decision to continue my studies, Degree in Applied Artificial Intelligence.

## Interests and Hobbies

As a curious individual, I am never afraid to try new things. A few years back, I was very involved with powerlifting where I get the satisfactory whenever I hit my personal best. In recent years, I have gotten really fond of rockclimbing as well as travelling. Good scenery and food always calms the soul.
