A full time university student on a quest to master the art of Artificial Intelligence. When I'm not busy convincing my code to run without breaking, you can find me capturing the world through my camera lensâ€”because if AI doesn't take over, at least I'll have some great photos to document it! My life is a fine balance between training neural networks and training myself to survive on minimal sleep. Join me on this adventure where the only thing more complex than AI algorithms is figuring out how to frame the perfect picture!
